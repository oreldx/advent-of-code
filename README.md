Advent of Code puzzles are designed to be interesting for humans to solve - no consideration is made for whether AI can or cannot solve a puzzle. If you want practice prompting an AI, there are almost certainly better exercises elsewhere designed with that in mind."* - Eric Wastl

# [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com)

This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code challenges. Advent of Code is an annual event with daily programming puzzles that cover a range of difficulty levels and problem types.

## Structure

Each year's challenges are organized in separate directories named `year_YYYY`, where `YYYY` represents the year. Within each year, each day's challenges are organized in separate directories named `day_X`, where `X` represents the day index as a 2 digits number.

```bash
AdventOfCode/
│
├── year_2023/
│   ├── day_01/
│   │   └── main.py
│   ├── day_02/
│   │   ├── main.py
│   ...
│
├── year_2024/
│   ├── day_01/
│   │   └── main.py
│   ├── day_02/
│   │   ├── main.py
│   ...
```

## Running the Solutions
To run a solution, navigate to the specific day's directory and run the Python script for the part you're interested in. For example:

```bash
cd ./year_2023/day_01
python main.py
```
